# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

## Project Topic & Description

We aim to **develop a real-time hand gesture recognition system** using Computer Vision (CV) and Machine Learning (ML).

The final goal is to enable **players of the Mafia game** (both beginners and experienced) to interact with each other and with the game moderator using **hand gestures captured through a webcam**.

#### This is valuable because:

- It makes the game more **immersive and interactive**, especially in online or hybrid formats
    
- Gestures provide **natural, fast, and silent communication**, which is essential in Mafia
    
- It demonstrates a practical application of deep learning models to **human-computer interaction**


#### Target users:

- **Beginner players** -> who can use visual cues instead of remembering complex rules
    
- **Experienced players** -> who benefit from fast, silent interaction without breaking immersion

2. Robustness: works across different people, skin tones, lighting, and backgrounds 
3. Performance
   * Prediction delay ≤ 200 ms per frame
   * Target ≥ 25 FPS on a standard laptop webcam
4. Usability & Stability: recognizes gestures consistently without false positives
